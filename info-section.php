                    Every personal injury case is worth a different amount
                    depending on the impact the injuries have on the
                    victim’s life and livelihood. The only way to get an
                    accurate estimate of the value of your claim is to speak
                    to an attorney. Otherwise, you may be able to get a
                    rough idea by looking at the costs of your economic and
                    non-economic damages. Adding up these expenses can give
                    you an idea of what your claim could be worth:
                  </p>
                  <p> <strong>Past and future accident-related medical expenses.</strong>

                  <p class="process-page__read-paragraph">
                    These may include the costs of hospitalization,
                    surgeries, medications, medical equipment, live-in
                    nursing care, rehabilitation, and home or vehicle
                    modifications.

                      These may include the costs of hospitalization,
                      surgeries, medications, medical equipment, live-in
                      nursing care, rehabilitation, and home or vehicle
                      modifications. Look at your existing medical bills and
                      what your injuries may cost in the future to calculate
                      these expenses. Lost wages. If your personal injuries
                      force you to miss time at work for treatment and
                      recovery, you could recover for these income losses
                      with your personal injury claim. This includes money
                      you likely would have made in raises and/or promotions
                      during this time. Property damage. Did your home,
                      vehicle, or other properties sustain costly damage in
                      the accident? You could recover the full costs to
                      repair or replace these damaged items. Add in the
                      costs of your property damage to your final
                      calculation. Pain and suffering. The courts will
                      calculate these non-economic losses using expert
                      testimony, medical records, and other evidence of your
                      physical pain and emotional suffering. Values can vary
                      greatly depending on the severity and type of injury.
                      Emotional distress. A PI claim could also result in
                      compensation for emotional harms the accident causes,
                      including mental and psychological damage. You may
                      also recover for lost capacity to earn if your
                      injuries cause permanent disability.

                    Learning the facts about personal injury accidents can
                    help you grasp the magnitude of this issue in the U.S.
                    According to the
                    <span class="legal-representation__orange-text">National Safety Council (NSC)</span>, unintentional injuries have been the fifth-leading
                    cause of death since 1991. In the United States, an
                    injury severe enough to require medical evaluation
                    occurs every second of every day. That translates into
                    <span><strong>4,520</strong></span>
                    injuries per hour,<span><strong> 108,500</strong></span>
                    per day,
                    <span> <strong>761,500 </strong></span>
                    per week, and nearly
                    <span> <strong>40 million each year </strong></span>.
                  </p>
                  <p class="legal-representation__description-learn">
                    Here are several other facts:
                    <span class="legal-representation__learn-more">
                      In 2012, the rate of men and women seeking medical
                      attention for injuries was almost equal. The rate was
                      slightly higher for women (51.8%) than men (48.2%).
                      Most injuries occurred in the home (51.9%). Injuries
                      in public (on streets, sidewalks, highways, and
                      parking lots) took second place at 12.6%, and injuries
                      at sports and recreation areas took third (12%). About
                      29% of all emergency department visits in 2011 were
                      injury-related. This equates to about 40.2 million
                      injury-related visits out of 136.3 million total.
                      There were
                      <span class="legal-representation__orange-text">4 million</span>
                      emergency department visits throughout the U.S. in
                      2013. OF these, 37.2 million were injury-related. The
                      most frequent body sites that sustained injuries were
                      the upper extremities, including the hands, wrists,
                      and fingers. The odds of becoming a victim of an
                      unintentional injury in your lifetime are high. It is
                      often not a matter of if, but when. Not all
                      unintentional injury victims have the right to sue
                      someone for financial recovery. Only those with
                      injuries that stem from someone else’s act of
                      negligence, carelessness, or lawlessness can bring
                      personal injury claims. Other types of claims, such as
                      product liability and premises liability, require
                      other elements of proof. Partner with an attorney for
                      facts about your specific injury.

                  In 2013 (the most recent year data is available),
                  unintentional injuries cost the United States
                  <span class="unintentional-cost__bold">$820.6 billion</span>. This includes the costs of both fatal and nonfatal
                  injuries, vehicle damages, medical expenses, productivity
                  losses, administrative fees, and employers insured and
                  uninsured costs.

                  The value of lost quality of life in 2013 equaled an

                    When employees sustain injuries that put them out of
                    work, America pays. Most of the $820.6 billion in
                    national expenses went toward wage and productivity
                    losses ($388.4 billion). The second-largest component
                    was medical expenses, totaling $219.8 billion in 2013.
                    The total cost of personal injuries to the U.S. is the
                    equivalent of 51 centers per dollar spent on food in the
                    country. The parties that absorb the costs of personal
                    injuries in the U.S. include private insurers ,
                    taxpayers, and the injured victims themselves.
